# Mohamed Aly's TrelLoapi

Hey there! This is my submission for the **Trello API** assignment for the PennLabs back-end web development project.

This is a Rails project. The front end with the HTML form is the home page at `app/views/static_pages/home.html.erb`; the database that handles the storage is located in the `db/` directory.

Hoping to push this up to Heroku so it is accessible via the Web and not just on a machine with Rails installed.
